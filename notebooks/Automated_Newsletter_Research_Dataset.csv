proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Along with this growth
in internet access is the risk of cyberattacks to vulnerable IoT devices
mushrooming in the African cyberspace. One way to determine IoT vulnerabilities
is to find open ports within Africa s cyberspace. Our research leverages Shodan
search engine, a powerful tool for discovering IoT devices facing the public
internet, to find open ports across Africa. We conduct an analysis of our
findings, ranking countries from most to least vulnerable to cyberattack. We
find that South Africa,Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and Nigeria are the five
countries most susceptible to cyberattack on the continent. Further, 69.8% of
devices having one of the five most commonly open internet ports have had past
documented vulnerabilities. Following our analysis, we conclude with policy

8,8,Predicting Insurance Penetration Rate in Ghana Using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model,"Thomas Gyima-Adu, Godwin Gidisu",2025-02-11,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07841v1,"Ghana records a low penetration of 1.05% compared to some of its African

the rate works out to the small amount of Gross Domestic Product. This research
seeks to model and forecast insurance penetration rate in Ghana using the
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average technique. The result indicates that
ARIMA (3,1,0) is the appropriate model for insurance penetration in Ghana.

density to be $\Omega_{\rm m}= 0.317^{+0.040}_{-0.031}$, the Hubble constant
$H_{0}=66.5^{+2.0}_{-1.9}\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and the rms

between common model parameters such as inertia, damping, and noise amplitude
and non-parametric estimations of the same directly from power-grid frequency
recordings. We propose two explanations for the non-Gaussian leptokurtic
distributions in South Africa: The first based on multiplicative noise in
power-grid frequency recordings, which we observe in South Africa; The second
based on the well-known scheduled and unscheduled load shedding and rolling
blackouts that beset South Africa. For the first we derive an analytic
expression of the effects of multiplicative noise that permits the estimation
of all statistical moments - and discuss drawbacks in comparison with the data;
For the second we employ a simple numerical analysis with a modular power grid

for food in turn puts pressure on agriculture in many countries. The impact of
climate change on the environment has made it difficult to produce food that
may be necessary to accommodate the growing population. Due to these concerns,
the agriculture sector is forced to move towards more efficient and sustainable
methods of farming to increase productivity. There is evidence that the use of
technology in agriculture has the potential to improve food production and food
sustainability; thereby addressing the concerns of food security. The Internet
of Things (IoT) has been suggested as a potential tool for farmers to overcome
the impact of climate change on food security. However, there is dearth of
research on the readiness of implementing IoT in South Africa's agricultural
sector. Therefore, this research aims to explore the readiness of the
agricultural sector of South Africa for a wide implementation of IoT. This
research conducts a desktop study through the lens of the PEST framework on the
special case of South Africa. A thematic literature and documents review was
deployed to examine the political, economic, societal and technological factors
that may facilitate or impede the implementation of IoT in the agricultural
sectors of South Africa. The findings suggest that the wide ranging political,
economic, societal and technological constructs enable the implementation of
IoT within South Africa's agricultural sector. The most important include
current policies, technological infrastructure, access to internet, and mobile
technology which places South Africa in a good position to implement IoT in

technique, new WISE images were produced at angular resolutions ranging from
2.6"" to 5.5"". Global measurements were performed in the four WISE bands, and
stellar masses and star-formation rates were estimated using published scaling
relations. Two methods were used to uncover the distribution of dust, one
relying on two-dimensional fits to the 3.4 micron images to model the
starlight, and the other one using a simple scaling and subtraction of the 3.4
micron images to estimate the stellar continuum contribution to the emission in
the 12 and 22 micron bands. The two galaxies differ markedly in their mid-IR
properties. The 3.4 micron brightness distribution can be well represented by
the superposition of two Sersic models in NGC 1316 and by a Sersic model and an
exponential disk in NGC 612. The WISE colors of NGC 1316 are typical of those
of early-type galaxies; those of NGC 612 are in the range found for
star-forming galaxies. From the 22 micron luminosity, we infer a star-formation
rate of about 0.7 solar masses per year in NGC 1316 and about 7 solar masses
per year in NGC 612. Spitzer spectroscopy shows that the 7.7-to-11.3 micron PAH
line ratio is significantly lower in NGC 1316 than in NGC 612. The WISE images

models using a gravity-model framework to explain spatiotemporal dynamics of
EVD in West Africa at both the national and district-level scales, and to
compare effectiveness of local interventions (e.g. local quarantine) and
long-range interventions (e.g. border-closures). Incorporating spatial
interactions, the gravity model successfully captures the multiple waves of
epidemic growth observed in Guinea. Model simulations indicate that
local-transmission reductions were most effective in Liberia, while long-range
transmission was dominant in Sierra Leone. The model indicates the presence of
spatial herd protection, wherein intervention in one region has a protective
effect on surrounding regions. The district-level intervention analysis
indicates the presence of intervention-amplifying regions, which provide
above-expected levels of reduction in cases and deaths beyond their borders.
The gravity-modeling approach accurately captured the spatial spread patterns
of EVD at both country and district levels, and helps to identify the most
effective locales for intervention. This model structure and intervention
analysis provides information that can be used by public health policymakers to
assist planning and response efforts for future epidemics.",arxiv,Epidemiology,2015,"Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone"

of April 18, 2020, with South Africa reporting $3\,034$ cases being hit hardest
in Sub-Saharan Africa. Several African countries, especially South Africa, have
already taken strong non-pharmaceutical interventions that include physical
distancing, restricted economic, educational and leisure activities and reduced
human mobility options. The required strengths and overall effectiveness of
such interventions, however, are debated because of simultaneous but opposing
interests in most African countries: strongly limited health care capacities
and testing capabilities largely conflict with pressured national economies and
socio-economic hardships on the individual level, limiting compliance to
intervention targets. Here we investigate implications of interventions on the
COVID-19 outbreak dynamics, focusing on South Africa before and after the
national lockdown enacted on March 27, 2020. Our analysis shows that initial
exponential growth of existing case numbers is consistent with doubling times
of about $2.5$ days. After lockdown, the growth remains exponential, now with
doubling times of 18 days, but still in contrast to subexponential growth
reported for Hubei/China after lockdown. Moreover, a scenario analysis of a
computational data-driven agent based mobility model for the Nelson Mandela Bay

levels of intervention measures and compliance until the end of April is of
insufficient length and still too weak, too unspecific or too inconsistently

consideration when attempting to build a modeling framework for wind speeds.
Ideally, wind speed modeling should be very efficient since the wind speed can
vary significantly from day to day or even hour to hour. But complex models
usually require high computational resources. This paper illustrates how to
construct and implement a hierarchical Bayesian model for wind speeds using the
Weibull density function based on a continuously-indexed spatial field. For
efficient (near real-time) inference the proposed model is implemented in the r
package R-INLA, based on the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA).
Specific attention is given to the theoretical and practical considerations of
including a spatial component within a Bayesian hierarchical model. The
proposed model is then applied and evaluated using a large volume of real data
sourced from the coastal regions of South Africa between 2011 and 2021. By
projecting the mean and standard deviation of the Matern field, the results
show that the spatial modeling component is effectively capturing variation in
wind speeds which cannot be explained by the other model components. The mean
of the spatial field varies between $\pm 0.3$ across the domain. These insights
are valuable for planning and implementation of green energy resources such as
wind farms in South Africa. Furthermore, shortcomings in the spatial sampling
domain is evident in the analysis and this is important for future sampling
strategies. The proposed model, and the conglomerated dataset, can serve as a
foundational framework for future investigations into wind energy in South

of WPV3-associated paralysis in Nigeria in November 2012. At the time of
writing, the most recent case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Nigeria
occurred in July 2014, and WPV1 has not been seen in Africa since a case in
Somalia in August 2014. No cases associated with circulating vaccine-derived
type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV2) have been detected in Nigeria since November 2014.
Has WPV1 been eliminated from Africa? Has WPV3 been eradicated globally? Has
Nigeria interrupted cVDPV2 transmission? These questions are difficult because
polio surveillance is based on paralysis and paralysis only occurs in a small
fraction of infections.
  This report provides estimates for the probabilities of poliovirus
elimination in Nigeria given available data as of March 31, 2015. It is based
on a model of disease transmission that is built from historical polio
incidence rates and is designed to represent the uncertainties in transmission
dynamics and poliovirus detection that are fundamental to interpreting long
time periods without cases.
  The model estimates that, as of March 31, 2015, the probability of WPV1
elimination in Nigeria is 84%, and that if WPV1 has not been eliminated, a new
case will be detected with 99% probability by the end of 2015. The probability
of WPV3 elimination (and thus global eradication) is >99%. However, it is
unlikely that the ongoing transmission of cVDPV2 has been interrupted; the
probability of cVDPV2 elimination rises to 83% if no new cases are detected by
April 2016.
  Added July 10, 2015: On June 26, a cVDPV2 case was confirmed by the Global

new information about cVDPV2 prevalence that is useful for assessing the

challenged by difficulties with disease surveillance, which impacted subsequent
analysis and decision-making regarding optimal interventions. We developed a
stage-structured model of Ebola virus disease (EVD). A key feature of the model
is that it includes a generalized correction term accounting for factors such
as the fraction of cases reported and fraction of the population at risk (e.g.
due to contact patterns, interventions, spatiotemporal spread, pre-existing
immunity, asymptomatic cases, etc.). We generated a range of short-term
forecasts for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, which we then validated using
subsequent data. We also used the model to examine the uncertainty in the
relative contributions to transmission by the different stages of infection
(early, late, and funeral). We found that a wide range of forecasted
trajectories fit approximately equally well to the early data. However, by
including the correction factor term the best-fit models correctly forecasted
EVD activity for all three countries, both individually and for all countries
combined. In particular, the model correctly forecasted the slow-down in
Liberia, as well as the continued exponential growth in Sierra Leone through
November 2014. Parameter unidentifiability issues hindered estimation of the
relative contributions of each stage of transmission from incidence and deaths
data alone, which poses a challenge in determining optimal intervention

leak to Stokes $I$. Subsequently, we simulate LOFAR observations of Galactic
diffuse polarized emission based on a model to assess what fraction of
polarized power leaks into Stokes $I$ because of the primary beam. We find that
the rms fractional leakage over the instrumental $k$-space is $0.35\%$ in the

role in the initiation of cumulus convection. Over the land surface, a
necessary boundary condition to consider for resolving land-atmosphere
interactions is soil moisture. The aim in the study is twofold. One, through
object oriented and traditional verification techniques determine how higher
resolution soil moisture initial conditions influences the prediction of the
location and timing of convective initiation (CI) within a convective
permitting, operational NWP model over South Africa. Two, to study the modelled
CI-soil moisture relationship during real afternoon thunderstorm events. The
study reports the results from 66 Unified Model simulations (at 4.4km grid
resolution) for nine summer afternoon CI events during synoptically benign
conditions over South Africa. The higher resolution soil moisture conditions
reduce centroid distance between observed and forecast storms on average by 7km
(9 percent improvement), with the most decrease in centroid distance occurring
at the shortest lead times, by 12km. Most improvement in location error occurs
in the zonal directional. However, little to no difference is found in the
timing of CI, most likely attributable to the dominant effect of model grid
size on CI timing, overshadowing the influence from soil moisture anomalies.
Probability of CI is highest over dry and moderate soils and areas along

117,117,The Long-Run Impact of Electoral Violence on Health and Human Capital in Kenya,Roxana Gutiérrez-Romero,2021-12-27,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13849v3,"This paper examines the long-term effects of prenatal, childhood, and teen
exposure to electoral violence on health and human capital. Furthermore, it
investigates whether these effects are passed down to future generations. We
exploit the temporal and spatial variation of electoral violence in Kenya
between 1992 and 2013 in conjunction with a nationally representative survey to
identify people exposed to such violence. Using coarsened matching, we find
that exposure to electoral violence between prenatal and the age of sixteen
reduces adult height. Previous research has demonstrated that protracted,
large-scale armed conflicts can pass down stunting effects to descendants. In
line with these studies, we find that the low-scale but recurrent electoral
violence in Kenya has affected the height-for-age of children whose parents
were exposed to such violence during their growing years. Only boys exhibit
this intergenerational effect, possibly due to their increased susceptibility
to malnutrition and stunting in Sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast to previous
research on large-scale conflicts, childhood exposure to electoral violence has
no long-term effect on educational attainment or household consumption per
capita. Most electoral violence in Kenya has occurred during school breaks,
which may have mitigated its long-term effects on human capital and earning
capacity.",arxiv,Political Science,2021,Kenya

the joint use of remote sensing and deep learning has achieved promising
results for population distribution estimation, most of the current work

thereby neglecting temporal analyses. In this work, we focus on evaluating how
deep learning change detection techniques can unravel temporal population
dynamics at short intervals. Since Post-Classification Comparison (PCC) methods
for change detection are known to propagate the error of the individual maps,
we propose an end-to-end population growth mapping method. Specifically, a
ResNet encoder, pretrained on a population mapping task with Sentinel-2 MSI
data, was incorporated into a Siamese network. The Siamese network was trained
at the census level to accurately predict population change. The effectiveness
of the proposed method is demonstrated in Kigali, Rwanda, for the time period
2016-2020, using bi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. Compared to PCC, the Siamese

whether BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) stock markets

adopted. The first presents an event-study methodology based on regression
estimation of abnormal returns. The second is based on vote intentions by

markets emerged losers, others took the opposite route. China took the biggest
hit with Brazil, while the damage was much more limited for India and South

neo-mercantilist attitude revolving around tearing up trade deals, instituting
tariffs, and labeling China a ""currency manipulator"". However, Russia looks to
be benefiting due to Trump's sympathetic attitude towards Vladimir Putin and

inequality in any given year, changes in the degree of sorting over time barely
have any impact on inequality. Further analysis reveals that this
counterintuitive result is due to different dynamics within educational groups.
The inequality-decreasing impact from reduced sorting among the highly educated
is almost entirely offset by the inequality-increasing impact from increased
sorting among the least educated. While it is certainly reassuring that
concerns about educational assortative mating having a potentially large effect
on income disparities between households appear to be unwarranted, these

approach builds on previous estimates of biodiscovery priorities by
simultaneously (1) considering linkages between spatio-environmental variables

sampling intensity and future biodiscovery potential, (3) incorporating a
priori knowledge about global species distribution patterns, (4) addressing
spatial autocorrelation in community composition, and (5) weighting theoretical
undocumented species by their predicted levels of conservation need. Using

structure of the isoscalar monopole (IS0) strength (a narrow low-energy
deformation-induced peak and a main broad ISGMR part). The energy of the narrow
low-lying IS0 peak is sensitive to both the incompressibility modulus
$K_\infty$ and the coupling between IS0 and isoscalar quadrupole (IS2)
strength.
  Objective: This study aims to investigate the two-peaked structure of the
ISGMR in the prolate $^{24}$Mg and oblate $^{28}$Si nuclei and identify among a
variety of energy density functionals based on Skyrme parameterisations the one
which best describes the experimental data. This will allow for conclusions

  Methods: The ISGMR was excited in $^{24}$Mg and $^{28}$Si using

explore the accelerating expansion of the universe without invoking the
traditional dark-energy model, as described in the Lambda cold dark matter
($\Lambda$CDM) model. Instead, the MSF model introduces parameters that
encapsulate the effects traditionally attributed to dark energy. To test the
viability of this MSF, we constrained the model using the observational Hubble
parameter (OHD), distance modulus measurements (SNIa), and their combined
datasets (OHD + SNIa). We implement a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
simulation to find the best-fit values of the model parameters. The MSF model
produced best-fit values for the parameter $p$ associated with the power law of
the matter-dominated era and $\beta$, the exponential parameter for the
darkenergy-dominated era. For our MSF, these values are $p$ = 0.28 and $\beta$
= 0.52 when using SNIa data, $p$ = 0.63 and $\beta$ = 0.30 for OHD data and $p$
= 0.45 and $\beta$ = 0.53 for a combination of datasets (OHD + SNIa). The
numerical results and plots of the deceleration parameter, fractional energy
density, Hubble parameter, and luminosity distance are presented which are the
key parameters for studying the accelerated expansion of the universe. We
compare the results of our model with that of the $\Lambda$CDM model and
reconcile them with astronomical observational data. Our results indicate that
the MSF model shows promise, demonstrating good compatibility with current
astronomical observations and performing comparably to the $\Lambda$CDM model

of the universe, while providing a unified framework that incorporates the

improved legal equality for women with noticeable effects in some countries.

disparities in scientific research in MENA. Specifically, we examine 1.7
million papers indexed in the Web of Science published by 1.1 million authors
from MENA between 2008 and 2020. We used bibliometric indicators to analyse
potential disparities between men and women in the share of authors, research
productivity, and seniority in authorship. The results show that gender parity
is far from being achieved in MENA. Overall, men authors obtain higher
representation, research productivity, and seniority. But some countries
standout: Tunisia, Lebanon, Turkey, Algeria and Egypt have higher shares or
women researchers compared to the rest of MENA countries. The UAE, Qatar, and

Saudi Arabia lags behind. We find that women are more likely to stop publishing
than men and that men publish on average between 11% and 51% more than women,

clinicians acquire fetal ultrasound planes for diagnosis of fetal

We begin with South Asia, where tracking reveals that MTCs change character
during their life, i.e., their track is composed of MTC and LTC phases. The
highest MTC-phase density and least motion is over the Arabian Sea, followed by
the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea. A MTC-phase composite shows an east-west
tilted warm above deep cold-core temperature anomaly with maximum vorticity at
600 hPa. While the LTC-phase shows a shallow cold-core below 800 hPa and a warm
upright temperature anomaly with lower tropospheric vorticity maximum. Apart
from South Asia, systems with similar morphology are observed over the west and
central Africa, east and west Pacific in boreal summer. In boreal winter,
regions that support MTCs include northern Australia, the southern Indian
Ocean, and South Africa. Relatively, the MTC fraction is higher equatorward,
where there is a cross-equatorial low-level jet that advects oppositely signed
vorticity. Whereas the LTCs are more prevalent further poleward. Finally, a
histogram of differential vorticity (difference between middle and lower
levels) versus the height of peak vorticity for cyclonic centers is bimodal.
One peak, around 600 hPa, corresponds to MTCs while the second, around 900 hPa,

response aimed at early screening of communities rather than individuals, as
well as travel restrictions to prevent community cross-contamination. Our
analysis shows the policies to be effective even at a relatively low level of
compliance. In our simulations, 40% of individuals conforming to these policies
is enough to stop the outbreak. Simulations with a 50% compliance rate are
consistent with the case counts in Liberia during the period of rapid decline

basic reproductive number, R_0, of the 2014-5 Ebola virus disease (EVD)

the likelihood for large outbreak sizes, e.g., exceeding hundreds of thousands

confidence intervals of the fitted R_0, and, in turn, the type and scope of
necessary interventions. In this manuscript we propose a hybrid
stochastic-deterministic method to estimate R_0 and associated confidence
intervals (CIs). The core idea is that stochastic realizations of an underlying
deterministic model can be used to evaluate the compatibility of candidate
values of R_0 with observed epidemic curves. The compatibility is based on
comparing the distribution of expected epidemic growth rates with the observed
epidemic growth rate given ""process noise"", i.e., arising due to stochastic
transmission, recovery and death events. By applying our method to reported EVD
case counts from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, we show that prior estimates
of R_0 based on deterministic fits appear to be more confident than analysis of
stochastic trajectories suggests should be possible. Moving forward, we
recommend including a hybrid stochastic-deterministic fitting procedure when

resulting in over 25,000 total infections and 15,000 total deaths. Mathematical
modeling can be used to investigate the mechanisms driving transmission during
this outbreak -- in particular, burial practices appear to have been major
source of infections. Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed a
multi-stage model of Ebola virus transmission linked to a game-theoretic model
of population burial practice selection. We fit our model to cumulative
incidence and mortality data from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone from
January 2014 to March, 2016. The inclusion of behavior change substantially
improved best fit estimates and final size prediction compared to a reduced
model with fixed burials. Best fit trajectories suggest that the majority of
sanitary burial adoption occurred between July, 2014 and October, 2014.
However, these simulations also indicated that continued sanitary burial
practices waned following the resolution of the outbreak.
Conclusions/Significance: Surveillance data from the 2014 outbreak appears to
have a signal of changes in the dominant burial practices in all three
countries. Increased adoption of sanitary burials likely attenuated
transmission, but these changes occurred too late to prevent the explosive
growth of the outbreak during its early phase. For future outbreaks, explicitly

162,162,A Multi-Stage Stochastic Programming Approach to Epidemic Resource Allocation with Equity Considerations,"Xuecheng Yin, I. Esra Buyuktahtakin",2021-02-23,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11814v1,"Existing compartmental models in epidemiology are limited in terms of
optimizing the resource allocation to control an epidemic outbreak under
disease growth uncertainty. In this study, we address this core limitation by
presenting a multi-stage stochastic programming compartmental model, which
integrates the uncertain disease progression and resource allocation to control
an infectious disease outbreak. The proposed multi-stage stochastic program
involves various disease growth scenarios and optimizes the distribution of
treatment centers and resources while minimizing the total expected number of
new infections and funerals. We define two new equity metrics, namely infection
and capacity equity, and explicitly consider equity for allocating treatment
funds and facilities over multiple time stages. We also study the multi-stage
value of the stochastic solution (VSS), which demonstrates the superiority of
the proposed stochastic programming model over its deterministic counterpart.
We apply the proposed formulation to control the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in
Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia of West Africa to determine the optimal and
fair resource-allocation strategies. Our model balances the proportion of
infections over all regions, even without including the infection equity or
prevalence equity constraints. Model results also show that allocating
treatment resources proportional to population is sub-optimal, and enforcing
such a resource allocation policy might adversely impact the total number of
infections and deaths, and thus resulting in a high cost that we have to pay
for the fairness. Our multi-stage stochastic epidemic-logistics model is
practical and can be adapted to control other infectious diseases in
meta-populations and dynamically evolving situations.",arxiv,Operations Research,2021,"Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia"

individual stars or emission by gas outside the galaxies, or more
speculatively, some hitherto unknown light sources such as decaying elementary

behavioral predictors in shaping digital legacy management.
  The objective of this study is to explore how behavioral predictors influence

  Investigating the impact of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived
behavioral control on these intentions. Exploring the perceived usefulness of
digital legacy management systems. Understanding the implications of response

the coupling strength between one particle-one hole (1p-1h) and two

Africa. A variant of the classical compartmental SEIR model, called the SEIQRDP
model, is used. As South Africa is still in the early phases of the global
COVID-19 pandemic with the confirmed infectious cases not having peaked, the
SEIQRDP model is first parameterized on data for Germany, Italy, and South
Korea - countries for which the number of infectious cases are well past their
peaks. Good fits are achieved with reasonable predictions of where the number
of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases will end up and by
when. South African data for the period from 23 March to 8 May 2020 is then
used to obtain SEIQRDP model parameters. It is found that the model fits the
initial disease progression well, but that the long-term predictive capability
of the model is rather poor. The South African SEIQRDP model is subsequently
recalculated with the basic reproduction number constrained to reported values.
The resulting model fits the data well, and long-term predictions appear to be
reasonable. The South African SEIQRDP model predicts that the peak in the
number of confirmed infectious individuals will occur at the end of October
2020, and that the total number of deaths will range from about 10,000 to
90,000, with a nominal value of about 22,000. All of these predictions are
heavily dependent on the disease control measures in place, and the adherence
to these measures. These predictions are further shown to be particularly
sensitive to parameters used to determine the basic reproduction number. The
future aim is to use a feedback control approach together with the South
African SEIQRDP model to determine the epidemiological impact of varying

significant. Compartmental models are a useful framework for investigating
transmission of diseases in societies. To understand how the infection will
spread and how to limit the outbreak. We have developed a modified SEIR
compartmental model with nine compartments (CoVCom9) to describe the dynamics
of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Ghana. We have carried out a detailed
mathematical analysis of the CoVCom9, including the derivation of the basic
reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_{0}$. In particular, we have shown that the
disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when
$\mathcal{R}_{0}<1$ via a candidate Lyapunov function. Using the SARS-CoV-2
reported data for confirmed-positive cases and deaths from March 13 to August
10, 2020, we have parametrised the CoVCom9 model. The results of this fit show
good agreement with data. We used Latin hypercube sampling-rank correlation
coefficient (LHS-PRCC) to investigate the uncertainty and sensitivity of
$\mathcal{R}_{0}$ since the results derived are significant in controlling the
spread of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate that over this five month period, the basic
reproduction number is given by $\mathcal{R}_{0} = 3.110$, with the 95\%
confidence interval being $2.042 \leq \mathcal{R}_0 \leq 3.240$, and the mean
value being $\mathcal{R}_{0}=2.623$. Of the 32 parameters in the model, we find
that just six have a significant influence on $\mathcal{R}_{0}$, these include
the rate of testing, where an increasing testing rate contributes to the

design alternative protocols for mobile money deposits and withdrawals that

Waste work in cities of the Global South is arranged with myriad actors, both formal and informal, who individually and collectively, and to varying capacities, play a distinctive yet interconnected role in the urban waste economy. These roles are interrelated and involve the management, movement and monetisation of recyclable waste. However, given the complexity of infrastructure(s), technology as well as urban socio-spatial stratification within contexts of the Global South, conventional frameworks that seek to explain waste work have limited capacity in delineating the varying role(s) of actors within a community of practice and how these roles are continuously changing through mutual interconnections and adaptation. This article explores Activity Theory as a framework for understanding how the role(s) of actors are continuously negotiated through mediating factors such as (i) technology/infrastructure; (ii) rules and regulations; (iii) community of actors and (iv) the division of labour. This article draws on an ethnographic case of intermediary waste workers within Cape Town’s urban waste economy, and rather than focussing on the role of individual actor(s) as (an) isolated element(s), this article embeds their individual roles in relation to a composite network of actors. The results of this article demonstrate how the role(s) of actors doing waste work are non-linear and are continuously mediated through their relations with technology, infrastructure and their interconnections with other actors. Moreover, this article provides holistic insight into new forms of knowledge production through waste work in the Global South, collaboration among myriad actors and the development of common consciousness toward the transformation and valorisation of waste.",scopus,Environmental Studies,2025,South Africa

It introduces “No-Organization” or the “it” as an invisible discursive frame that constructs the continent as a space devoid of Organization. I use No-Organization to reengage two scholarly approaches invested in decentering the West and addressing the erasure of Africa in Organization Studies. The first approach deconstructs Western-centric representations in the literature, while the second one generates studies better attuned to African contexts and theories. I claim that both approaches overlook the deeper antiblack knowledge structure in which misrepresentations and contextual research exist. I offer No-Organization as a third approach, which allows us to grasp the unpalpable and recover expressions of Black and African social life in scholarly work. ",scopus,African Studies,2025,Africa
214,214,“Going beyond the call of duty”: academic agency and promoting transformation for sustainability in higher education,Idahosa G.E.o.,2025-01-02,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJSHE-09-2023-0454,"
Purpose
In the past decade, against increasing global inequality, higher education has grappled with increased demands for social justice, transformation and decolonisation. While a lot of research in South Africa has focused on the (im)possibilities of fostering racial, gendered, socio-economic and cultural change, the connection of such change to questions of sustainability has been less explored. The purpose of this paper is to specifically explore the agency of academics to foster transformative initiatives for sustainability within the context of institutions historically serving under-represented populations.


Design/methodology/approach
Using a qualitative methodology, this paper highlights the importance of considering sustainability in processes of transformation. This paper is specifically interested in how academic faculty and those in assigned leadership positions view their agency in relation to promoting transformation for sustainability at the institutional level. Drawing on data generated from semi-structured interviews with 13 participants at an historically Black university in South Africa, this paper details academics' and leaders’ experiences and perceptions of their agency.


Findings
This study reveals the adverse interactional dynamics within higher education institutions, which negatively impact academics’ participation as key agents in change processes. Positional and identity challenges faced reveal the persistence of colonial and apartheid legacies of racism, sexism, Afrophobia and xenophobia – which casts a shadow on possible trajectories of transformation and sustainability. This has serious implications for the common good, given South Africa's regional import for knowledge production and decolonisation within universities; its key role in the African 2063 Agenda; and the wider global Sustainable Development agenda.


Originality/value
This study highlights insufficient engagement with the sustainability of transformation efforts within the context of South Africa. This study also emphasises the relation between transformation imperatives and racial, socio-economic, gender and epistemic justice imperatives of sustainable development.

The aim was to highlight the connectedness of the study findings, and to develop a conceptual framework that can inform future studies on gender equity in academia across West Africa.MethodsA content analysis of the research outputs was conducted using four theoretical frameworks to assess the alignment of the study findings with gender equality goals. The research examined policy effectiveness and institutional practices using the 2008 USAID Gender Equality Framework; analyzed how personal traits, societal expectations, and organizational practices intersect using Fagenson's Theory of Gender and Career Development; uncovered gendered power dynamics and inform strategies for institutional reform using the Feminist Institutionalism Analytical Lens; and shed light on disparities in mentorship, collaboration, and academic publishing using the Academic Literacies Theory.ResultsThe key domains influencing gender inequality and requiring targeted actions are: first, the patriarchal societal, cultural, and religious values that shape gender roles, restricting women's career advancement. Second, institutional policies and organizational culture that limits female leadership and research productivity. Third, individual and generational perspectives influence advocacy, with younger individuals recognizing inequality more readily. Research productivity and leadership disparities can be addressed through mentorship and training programs for early-career researchers that foster the development of gender-sensitive advocates. The developed conceptual framework outlines three core research and action domains—societal, institutional, and individual factors—and their sub-factors, alongside targeted interventions influencing gender inequality, proposed targeted recommendations and expected outcomes.ConclusionsThe findings emphasize the multifaceted nature of gender disparities. Strategic actions are needed to address the issues that foster gender equality in medical and dental research institutions, and to support female researchers in West Africa. These actions should focus on the younger generations to drive needed changes.",scopus,Gender Studies,2025,Nigeria

Despite shifts in science policy and funding modalities, international research collaborations continue to be shaped by inequalities that structure global science. These include a skewed division of tasks and unequal scientific authority in North-South partnerships. Existing scholarship highlights scholars’ experiences of such inequalities, but offers little explanation of how they are reproduced and affect joint knowledge production.
We address this gap with an empirical study of six African-European research projects on forests. Drawing on Bourdieu’s sociology of science, we employ a praxeological methodology that includes participant observation in collaborative meetings, analysis of project-related documents and reflexive interviews with scholars involved. We show discrepancies between how collaborators’ relations were designed and practiced: Even when projects had been set up as equal partnerships aimed at joint knowledge making, the emerging collaboration orders tended to reflect differential roles and unequal authority in epistemic choices. While African scholars exerted authority over field work, European scholars directed the ‘how to’ of conducting forest governance research. We explain the continuity of this pattern with Bourdieu’s notion of the habitus: a practical sense of roles scholars have internalised, resulting from their positions in global science and the capitals (economic, scientific, social, symbolic) they are endowed with.
The study illuminates how and why inequalities in research collaborations persist, regardless of formal project constellations and contrary to individual intentions. It highlights the potential of Bourdieusian theory for empirical science studies, with habitus as a concept explaining discrepancies between desired forms of collaboration and actual collaboration practice.",scopus,Sociology,2025,"African, European"

However, New Zealand's RNMI research output relative to global trends is under‐examined. This project evaluates New Zealand's RNMI research output between 1996 and 2022 compared to selected countries while highlighting global RNMI research output trends.MethodsA bibliometric‐based performance analysis was conducted using publication data from the SCImago Journal, the Country Rank portal, Clarivate InCites Benchmarking, and the Analytics platform. Registration data of RNMI professionals by country was collected to evaluate the relationship between research output and the number of registered professionals.ResultsAmong the seven selected countries (the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa), New Zealand's research output was low, even when adjusted for population size and the number of professionals. A significant positive correlation was found between the number of registered RNMI professionals and the number of RNMI publications. Despite this, New Zealand had the highest percentage of RNMI documents cited.ConclusionAlthough New Zealand's RNMI publications follow the global upward trend, it does so at a proportionate loss. New Zealand ranked low in most bibliometric indicators apart from the percentage of documents cited, where it showed a notable citation impact.

In this piece I want to emphasize another kind of bureaucratic knowledge production: namely, information about the bureaucratic system that was created through bureaucratic practice — what I call “studied bureaucratic knowledge.” Beyond understanding German attempts to translate (linguistically, administratively, and culturally) one understanding of bureaucracy, the historian who pays attention to the users of colonial bureaucratic structures can uncover bureaucratic knowledge created by those who encountered those structures in their daily lives — and how that information in turned shaped their use of the bureaucratic system.",scopus,Anthropology,2025,Germany
219,219,Limits of circularity: Examining ruptures to valuation work in Tunisia's used clothing economy,Grüneisl K.,2025-01-01,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/25148486251317415," Used clothing has long constituted a cherished consumer good and crucial source of livelihoods in Tunisia. Yet a marked deterioration in the quality of used garment imports, as well as the proliferation of homogenous fast-fashion stocks, has diminished opportunities for value retrieval. This article sets out from this qualitative decline on the markets of North Africa's largest current importer and re-exporter of used clothing to challenge framings of the global used clothing trade as a circular economy. Circularity, which is primarily premised on possibilities of reuse in the clothing value chain, has been promoted as an economically viable solution to the apparel industry's surplus production and the catastrophic environmental impact of ever-faster cycles of production, consumption and discard. However, images of illicit textile waste dumps in the Global South have exposed how the global used garment trade shifts a disposal problem to countries with weaker regulatory frameworks. This article extends such critiques of circularity by shifting attention from the dumpsite to the economic processes by which diverse actors actually enable reuse. An ethnographic study of what the article terms valuation work sheds light on the labour-intensive, material practices that enable circularity, but that are also prone to rupture or breakdown. This in turn elucidates how qualitative changes on the global used clothing market erode profit margins and devalue labour at a particular back end of the value chain. Unpacking the contingent and site-specific processes that show how the circular economy works in practice not only exposes the social and environmental injustices the framing obfuscates; it also points to alternative forms of knowledge production that might reorient critical debates about what circularity is and can be in the future.

There is a scarcity of research on AER that unpacks trends, challenges and opportunities especially in a changing global space. This mixed methods bibliometric study examines AER in Africa. Using an appropriate search string, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), a dataset of 265 research outputs was extracted and then analysed using VOSviewer. While annual research outputs have increased between 2004 and 2024, they remain low compared to other disciplines. A significant portion of research is funded by external organisations, underscoring a reliance on international support. The analysis highlights a small group of prolific African authors contributing to the field, though inter-African collaboration is weak. Instead, there is significant collaboration with researchers from the United States, reflecting the global nature of AER partnerships. Research outputs are highly concentrated in a few countries, notably South Africa, Egypt, and Kenya, while several African nations register no publications, revealing marked disparities across the continent. Author keyword analysis indicates a strong focus on themes such as curriculum development, food security, sustainability, and climate change, issues critical to the continent’s agricultural and educational development.

In 2015, the United Nations adopted 17 sustainable development objectives (SDGs) with goals to be reached by 2030. However, as amply reported in the scientific and development literature, none of the goals are on track to be achieved globally. This is particularly true for sub-Saharan Africa. Under a complex socio-environmental context, it is argued that major transformations and new approaches demand a stronger science–policy–society interface. Given the dynamic, multi- and interdisciplinary nature of the research for and on SDGs, there is a broad consensus that sustainability science is one of the instrumental approaches to their implementation. Based on sociological grounds, and in a framework of innovation systems and knowledge production, this paper aims to analyze the main challenges of five sub-Saharan African countries regarding innovation and knowledge production within the sustainability science approach. Based on primary data arising from field interviews and focus groups, and combined with desk research and bibliometric studies, the paper presents differences and commonalities among the country studies. These are used toward the definition of a set of five principles to guide the uptake of the sustainable science approach in the subregion in the discussion section: fostering intra-regional cooperation; multi- and interdisciplinary research; involving other stakeholders and knowledge systems; reinforcing the science–policy interface; and the evaluation data and methods.",scopus,Environmental Science,2025,None

This paper contributes to that literature using a historical comparative approach to construct the histories of learned societies that emerged during the colonial and postcolonial periods to understand how such scientific associations contributed to research productivity. I advance two arguments based on case studies of three scientific societies. First, there is linearity in the evolution of learned societies. Second, the institutionalization of scientific communities along interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary lines provided flexibility and enabled learned associations to contribute relevant knowledge to the “developmental state” that the political leaders were constructing.",scopus,History,2025,Ghana

However, most of the studies on the modal split of intra urban trips found in the literature focused on Europe, America, and Southeast Asia with little emphasis on Africa. The lacuna this trend creates motivates this study to present evidence from Nigeria using the centenary city of Enugu as a case study. This study is critical for knowledge production that drives explicit outline strategies for the development of a sustainable urban transportation system in Nigeria. Data on modal split and determinant factors were collected from primary source through the use of a questionnaire. Discriminant analysis was used to classify the modal split of intra urban trips in Enugu into two groups’ namely public and private transport. Although public transport modes are the most used for intra urban trips, the mode share indicates that private transport mode (car) is the most used single mode for intra urban trips. More than three-quarters of commuters that use private transport for intra urban trips prefer the mode, whereas a little less than one-fifth of commuters will switch to public transport modes. On the other hand, most of the commuters that use public transport for intra urban trips prefer the modes and very few others will switch to private transport. Car ownership has the strongest influence on the modal split. The study identifies the need for policy interventions that reflects better understating of the dynamics of intra urban trips.

West Africa became more strategically important during the Second World War owing to the air reinforcement route to Northeast Africa. The West African Air Reinforcement Route (WARR) went across the colony of Nigeria into the African interior. Geographical knowledge production was important for the smooth running of these air logistics operations. The United States, which came on the air supply route in support of the British war effort, was involved in map production for this purpose. Hence, this paper explores the United States military cartography of WARR, used during the Second World War. In particular, it examines the 1942 image of Northwest Yorùbáland. This paper contends that the reproduced African landscapes of the Geographical Section of the General Staff (GSGS) 2465 Series convey ideological meanings. As a social practice, cartography during this global conflict resulted in further territorial ordering and control over the ground and air space of this part of West Africa.

The political and economic instability in the Arab world has impacted the advancement of healthcare and the output of research. This review seeks to evaluate the quantity and quality of rheumatology-related research conducted in the Arab world. This review examined the number of rheumatological clinical publications produced by Arab countries between 2017 and 2021 and cited by PubMed/MEDLINE. Publications with authors from multiple nations were disqualified. Publications were then categorized by type, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, systematic reviews, narrative reviews, and case reports. Publications were also organized according to the regions of the Arab world: North and East Africa, the Middle East, and the Arabian Peninsula. The review also used data from the world bank to evaluate the gross domestic product (GDP) and total population of Arabian nations in order to calculate a ratio of publications to GDP and publications to population. Egypt had the highest number of publications among north and east African countries and Arab countries in general, with 261 publications, including the highest number of RCTs, which were 23. With 81 publications, Saudi Arabia had the highest number of publications on the Arabian peninsula. However, no individual country on the Arabian peninsula published an RCT. Lebanon had the most publications in the Middle East, but the majority were reviews and case reports. Tunisia had the highest ratio of publications to GDP.

The literature search focused based on school leadership and gender, linked to all 54 African countries.   The review focused on articles in non-predatory journals, plus university theses.
The review provides a compelling picture of school leadership and gender in Africa, with three main findings.  First, there is limited knowledge production on this important topic, with no sources identified in most African countries.  Second, organisational, social and personal factors combine to inhibit women's accession to school leadership.  Third, African women principals are shown to be more collegial and collaborative than men, with some evidence that they may be more effective school leaders.
The article’s conclusion draws out three main implications.   First, the findings indicate a strong need for ministries of education to review their recruitment and selection policies to address barriers to women's accession as school principals.  Second, they show deeply embedded social attitudes that women should be focused on domestic and family responsibilities, rather than school leadership.  This calls for community education programmes to address family and social attitudes.   Third, while the article presents a significant picture of the extent and nature of women principals' leadership accession and enactment across the continent, further research is recommended to address knowledge gaps, especially in those African countries where there is no knowledge production on school leadership and gender.",scopus,Education Studies,2022,Africa

The interrogation of these sources in relation to the expectations of the current and future HEIs to remain socially relevant and sustainable is carried out. HEIs in Africa must contribute to socio-economic change and engage with their quad-helix and eco-system partners to ensure that high end skills training, knowledge production, entrepreneurship and innovation are accelerated.

229,229,How does academia respond to the burden of infectious and parasitic disease?,Zhao W.,2022-12-01,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12961-022-00889-0,"Abstract
Background
Academic research is one of the main avenues through which humans can fight the threat of infectious diseases. However, there have been concerns regarding whether the academic system has provided sufficient efforts to fight infectious diseases we potentially face. Answering these questions could contribute to evidence-based recommendations for setting research priorities and third-mission policies.

Methods
With a focus on one of the most common categories of communicable diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases (IPDs), we searched Web of Science for articles and reviews relevant to IPDs published during the period 2000–2019 and retrieved WHO data on disease burden in corresponding years. The academic response patterns were explored by IPD subcategory and by human development level (an index established by the United Nations). We conduct the analysis in particular to gain insight into the dynamic relationship between disease burden and research effort on IPDs, scientific efforts contributed by countries with different development levels, and the variation trends in international joint efforts.

Results
The greatest burden of IPDs is clustered in the developing regions of Africa, but has received academic response from both developed and developing countries. Highly developed countries dominate the ranks of academic research in this area, yet there is also a clear increase in research efforts from the countries most affected, despite their low human development scale. In fact, the overall analysis reveals an improved capability for addressing local problems from African regions. In terms of international collaboration, highly developed countries such as the United States and United Kingdom have commonly collaborated with needy regions, whereas prolific but developing nations, like China, have not.

Conclusions
From a global perspective, academia has positively responded to health needs caused by IPDs. Although the relevant research output contribution is primarily from the highly developed countries, concentrated and specialized efforts from the undeveloped regions to ease their local burden can be clearly observed. Our findings also indicate a tendency to focus more on local health needs for both developed and undeveloped regions. The insights revealed in this study should benefit a more informed and systemic plan of research priorities.

Despite significant efforts made, limited research ideas are conceptualised and implemented in low-resource settings to tackle diseases of poverty, and this is especially true in sub-Saharan Africa. There is strong evidence to show that the barriers to locally led research do not vary largely between disease, study type and location and can be largely solved by addressing these common gaps. The European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) was established in 2003 as a European response to the global health crisis caused by the three main poverty-related diseases HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. EDCTP has established a model of long-term sustainable capacity development integrated into clinical trials which addresses this lack of locally led research in sub-Saharan Africa, supporting the development of individual and institutional capacity and research outputs that change the management, prevention and treatment of poverty-related and neglected infectious diseases across Africa. In recognition of emergent data on what the barriers and enablers are to long-term, sustainable capabilities to run studies, EDCTP formed a new collaboration with The Global Health Network (TGHN) in September 2017, with the aim to make a set of cross-cutting tools and resources to support the planning, writing and delivery of high-quality clinical trials available to research staff wherever they are in the world, especially those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) via TGHN platform. These new resources developed on the ‘EDCTP Knowledge Hub’ are those identified in the mixed method study described in this commentary as being key to addressing the gaps that the research community report as the most limiting elements in their ability to design and implement studies. The Knowledge Hub aims to make these tools freely available to any potential health research team in need of support and guidance in designing and running their own studies, particularly in low-resource settings. The purpose is to provide open access to the specific guidance, information and tools these teams cannot otherwise access freely. Ultimately, this will enable them to design and lead their own high-quality studies addressing local priorities with global alignment, generating new data that can change health outcomes in their communities.",scopus,Medicine,2022,Africa

In their development cooperation, FOCAC-based initiatives posture to bridge inequality and disparity between both sides often through the transfer of knowledge. Regarding this, the Forum employs knowledge sharing as a combination of capacity development initiatives in the form of training and educational, technical, human capacity-building and human resource development, including technology cooperation. However, citing marginal impact on industrialization processes of African countries, sceptics maintain that FOCAC’s trail in the so-called ‘second continent’ translates as a systematic imposition of a Beijing-centric paradigm of globalization.

The 49 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries together published just 5281 papers, of which South Africa’s contribution was 2206 (42% of the SSA total, 14% of all Africa) and Nigeria’s contribution was 997 (19% of the SSA total, 4% of all Africa). Cancer research accounted for 7.9% of all African biomedical research outputs (African research in infectious diseases was 5.1 times than that of cancer research). Research outputs that are proportionally low relative to their burden across Africa are paediatric, cervical, oesophageal and prostate cancer. African research mirrored that of Western countries in terms of its focus on discovery science and pharmaceutical research. The percentages of female researchers in Africa were comparable with those elsewhere, but only in North African and some Anglophone countries.ConclusionsThere is an imbalance in relevant local research generation on the continent and cancer control efforts. The recommendations articulated in our five-point plan arising from these data are broadly focused on structural changes, for example, overt inclusion of research into national cancer control planning and financial, for example, for countries to spend 10% of a notional 1% gross domestic expenditure on research and development on cancer.",scopus,Oncology,2022,"South Africa, Nigeria"

Despite their ecological and economic importance, it is likely that pests go unreported in many regions. Using a global dataset of tree pests and multiple metrics of pest diversity standardized for host availability, we describe the biogeography of under‐reporting and reveal potential for future pest invasions.LocationGlobal.Time periodContemporary.Major taxa studiedPathogens, insect pests and native tree hosts.MethodsWe assembled the global distributions of 3,828 tree pests and 2,689 host tree species across 226 countries, and calculated two metrics of pest diversity that account for host availability: pest saturation (i.e., the proportion of the known pests of native host trees present with countries) and pest deficit (the number of known pests of native trees that have not yet been reported in countries). We used Bayesian regression models to identify how sampling, socio‐economic variables, climate and ecological drivers affect estimates of pest saturation and deficit.ResultsWe show that most countries are reported to have fewer than 50% of the pests for which native hosts are available—corresponding to hundreds of additional pest species per country. Pest saturation was lowest in Africa and central Asia, while pest deficit was highest in eastern Europe. Accounting for research output, pest saturation was higher in warmer and wetter countries, while pest deficit was highest in countries with greater host phylogenetic diversity. Low saturation and high deficit even in well‐documented countries suggest a considerable potential for pest range expansion if barriers to dispersal are lowered.Main conclusionsOur findings indicate that, although all countries could potentially host additional pests, countries with low research output and high host diversity should be prioritized for future pest discovery and surveillance to ensure timely detection and implementation of pest mitigation strategies.",scopus,Environmental Science,2022,"Africa, central Asia, eastern Europe"

Drawing on interviews with urban pedagogues and practitioners, and examining institutional histories across Asia and Africa, we use a five-point framework to analyse these challenges: what to teach, how to teach, whom to teach, who teaches and where to teach. We find that different institutional arrangements and choices made by educators affect the answers to these questions in different ways. These questions are also closely connected to the questions of planning “for what”, and planning education “to what end”, and relate to concerns regarding values and processes and to outcomes for urban equality in the South. Considering these cases together offers an opportunity to contribute to a Southern dialogue on the evolution of planning education. ",scopus,Urban Studies,2022,"Asia, Africa"

Discrete academic studies have indicated that African Knowledge paradigms have not found a home in South Africa’s Westernised academies yet; knowledge patterns remain foreign and colonized. The current curriculum at a section of Historically White Universities in South Africa largely reflects the colonial and apartheid worldviews and is disconnected from African realities, including the lived experiences of most black South Africans, taking into account Arts and Humanities. Based on an examination of the decoloniality project and curriculum dishonesty and reform through literature study, the article calls for critical rethinking and reconfiguration, which should position South Africa, Africa, and last of all, the globe at the centre of knowledge production. Epistemic decoloniality at South Africa’s Historically White Universities should not be pursued with knowledge violence but rather with scholarly debate. This article introduces the framework of decoloniality by tracing the genesis of (South) Africa’s knowledge coloniality and initiates a discussion on the current epistemic decoloniality in South Africa’s Westernised higher education. The focus is on curriculum justice and knowledge integration across Historically White Universities in South Africa.

In doing so, the article seeks to contribute to the ongoing discussion around methodology and methods in critical security studies and other related fields in international relations by focusing on (researchers’) bodies as sites of knowledge production and intervention. Building on three empirical themes of fragmentation, labelling and gatekeeping that emerged from fieldwork in Abuja, Nigeria, I demonstrate how embodiment operates in active research contexts in the production – and problematization – of in/security. To do this, I draw inspiration from ideas around state archival practice; embodiment in critical security studies, especially as discussed in feminist and postcolonial work; and in/security theory to scaffold my broader methodological approach. A focus on embodiment, the article argues, marks the researcher’s body – and research – as integral to the development of theories and findings about security. At the same time, exploring the ways in which the (researcher’s) body is (re)produced in relation to identity and subjectivity encourages greater reflexivity in our research practice and fieldwork, as we are continually reminded that our work and our words are grounded in the standpoints that we occupy. The article concludes by identifying some useful strategies from my fieldwork for grappling with the challenges and tensions that emerge from bodily encounters in (security) research process.

Kopano Matlwa’s novel Spilt Milk, like most campus fiction, evokes and challenges the South African academy, and looks at ways of making the school and/or university a hospitable place. Unlike Matlwa’s sister novels Coconut and Period Pain, Spilt Milk has received few scholarly reviews. I examine how the novel reveals and can be read as a starting point in exploring the intellectual dimensions of colonialism. I investigate the decolonial concept of the coloniality of knowledge and Matlwa’s seeming quest for decolonial education by foregrounding the educational institution Sekolo sa Ditlhora as the prime setting of the novel. The argument around the coloniality of knowledge I advance here is akin to current debates seeking to decolonise (or Africanise) education in South African schools and universities. Theoretically, this article draws from the decolonial ideas on the coloniality of knowledge whose foundations were laid by the Peruvian sociologist Aníbal Quijano, who suggested that, for global domination, colonisers imposed their own modes of knowing and methods of producing knowledge. The concept of the coloniality of knowledge in Matlwa’s fiction is multifaceted since it speaks to the colonisation of space, education, languages, and the ways of life of the colonised people. Following the 2015 #RhodesMustFall protests at South African universities, I argue that the characterisation of Mohumagadi, and her foregrounding of Africa as an epistemic site from which she interprets the world, is an attempt at moving the centre.",scopus,Postcolonial Studies,2022,South Africa

We examine publications on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in nine leading political science journals across three decades (1990–2019) to evaluate the scope of political science engagement with the region since the 1990s and analyze trends in research interests, developments in the use of empirical methods, and authorship patterns. Our data highlight significant gaps in the geographic and substantive scope of extant scholarship. Specifically, the disproportionate focus on non-Arab countries and limited engagement with certain topics, including identity, nationalism, and state formation, raise concerns about selection bias and causal misidentification. Nevertheless, we find encouraging trends with respect to methodological developments; however, the methods and data sources employed appear to be determined by case selection to some extent. We also note that few MENA-based scholars currently publish in these journals. These findings have important implications for the integration of MENA studies with and knowledge production in political science.",scopus,Political Science,2022,None

Because of its extremely fast spreading, the attention of the global scientific community is now focusing on slowing down, containing and finally stopping the spread of this disease. This requires the concerted action of researchers and practitioners of many related fields, raising, as always in such situations the question, of what kind of research has to be conducted, what are the priorities, how has research to be coordinated and who needs to be involved. In other words, what are the characteristics of the response of the global research community on the challenge? In the present paper, we attempt to characterise, quantify and measure the response of academia to international public health emergencies in a comparative bibliometric study of multiple outbreaks. In addition, we provide a preliminary review of the global research effort regarding the defeat of the COVID-19 pandemic. From our analysis of six infectious disease outbreaks since 2000, including COVID-19, we find that academia always responded quickly to public health emergencies with a sharp increase in the number of publications immediately following the declaration of an outbreak by the WHO. In general, countries/regions place emphasis on epidemics in their own region, but Europe and North America are also concerned with outbreaks in other, developed and less developed areas through conducting intensive collaborative research with the core countries/regions of the outbreak, such as in the case of Ebola in Africa. Researches in the fields of virology, infectious diseases and immunology are the most active, and we identified two characteristic patterns in global science distinguishing research in Europe and America that is more focused on public health from that conducted in China and Japan with more emphasis on biomedical research and clinical pharmacy, respectively. Universities contribute slightly less than half to the global research output, and the vast majority of research funding originates from the public sector.

Background
Since its inception in 2009, the Consortium for Advanced Research Training in Africa (CARTA) program has focused on strengthening the capacity of nine African universities and four research centres to produce skilled researchers and scholars able to improve public and population health on the continent. This study describes the alignment between CARTA-supported doctoral topics and publications with the priorities articulated by the African public and population health research agenda.

Methods
We reviewed the output from CARTA PhD fellows between 2011 and 2018 to establish the volume and scope of the publications, and the degree to which the research focus coincided with the SDGs, World Bank, and African Development Bank research priority areas. We identified nine key priority areas into which the topics were classified.

Results
In total, 140 CARTA fellows published 806 articles in peer-reviewed journals over the 8 years up to 2018. All the publications considered in this paper had authors affiliated with African universities, 90% of the publications had an African university first author and 41% of the papers have CARTA fellows as the first author. The publications are available in over 6300 online versions and have been cited in over 5500 other publications. About 69% of the published papers addressed the nine African public and population health research agenda and SDG priority areas. Infectious diseases topped the list of publications (26.8%), followed by the health system and policy research (17.6%), maternal and child health (14.7%), sexual and reproductive health (14.3%).

Conclusions
Investments by CARTA in supporting doctoral studies provides fellows with sufficient training and skills to publish their research in fields of public and population health. The number of publications is understandably uneven across Africa’s public and population priority areas. Even while low in number, fellows are publishing in areas such as non-communicable disease, health financing, neglected tropical diseases and environmental health. Violence and injury is perhaps underrepresented. There is need to keep developing research capacity in partner institutions with low research output by training more PhDs in such institutions and by facilitating enabling environments for research.

Purpose
The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) initiatives in the repositories of federal government-owned universities due to the poor global visibility of ETDs from Nigeria.


Design/methodology/approach
An explanatory case study empirical research method was adopted for the study. Using an adapted methodology of Ghosh (2009) and multiple data gathering techniques, data was collected based on the three domains of the network of excellence on digital libraries (DELOS) digital library reference model.


Findings
The ETD initiatives in repositories of Nigerian federal universities have not made remarkable progress as digital libraries based on policy, content and system architecture. The specificity of ETDs is not clearly stated in the policies where available. The repositories housing the ETDs are also not compliant with the open archive initiative-protocol for metadata harvesting framework.


Research limitations/implications
The study focussed on ETD initiatives in federal government-owned universities. Although the findings of the study are relevant to other institutions in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa. It cannot be used as a basis for the generalisation based on other performance metrics.


Practical implications
This research study concluded that electronic theses and dissertations in Nigerian institutional repositories are not well managed for effective service delivery and long-term accessibility. The ill-management of the ETD initiatives is the reason for the poor global visibility and accessibility of these research output from this part of Africa.


Originality/value
The study assessed ETD initiatives using constructs from a theoretical framework.

As international organizations became increasingly involved in Cameroon in the postwar period, French military doctors claimed authority through specific expertise on medicine in the African “bush.” After Cameroon became independent, however, the building of new medical school became a focus of French anxieties about maintaining power in new African institutions of technical expertise and knowledge production. While scholars have begun to foreground the international context of Franco-African relations after independence, this article reveals how the distinct politics of Cameroon’s decolonization, growing out of its history as a United Nations (UN) trust territory, shaped French approaches to medical institutions there. Moreover, negotiations over the future of rural medicine in Cameroon highlighted the ways in which the approaches championed by French doctors relied on colonial authority itself.",scopus,History,2020,Cameroon

In this article, we combine the two fields, and by utilizing social media data, we create an innovative network science approach to analyze the production environment of digital innovations in Africa. We focus on three innovation hubs that we conceptualize as niches and innovation intermediaries that not only create communities to develop, test and implement new technology but also function as networks to discuss and form new ideas around innovations. Our key findings show how local communities are embedded in larger innovation structures. The connections between local stakeholders and global actors are predominantly created through bridge actors, who hold key positions in their communities. With tools from network science, we demonstrate that these linking elements can regulate and steer discussions and therefore, strongly influence digital niche environments.

In this article, we aim to quantify the current and historic capacity for African knowledge production to support the green economy in Africa, and identify important topical gaps. With a focus on topics relating to Governing Inclusive Green Growth in Africa (GIGGA), our research mapped how much Africa-focused research is being produced, from where and which African countries have higher or lower supply; and the topical focus of the research, mapping it against the African GIGGA policy discourses visible in government strategies. To do this we undertook a systematic review using a two-stage process, mapping the literature for GIGGA. This resulted in 960 verified citations. Content analysis of core metadata and article abstracts enabled mapping of the research focus. The analysis revealed a significant role for South Africa as both the pre-eminent producer of GIGGA literature as well as the geographic focus of GIGGA research, with Nigeria, Ethiopia and Kenya representing emerging loci of credible, African-relevant knowledge production. Topically, there was a strong emphasis on development, policy and environment while topics important for growth that is inclusive in character were infrequent or absent.

Led by historians and drawing heavily on insights from anthropology, it led to a revolution in the understanding of Africa, which nonetheless failed to maintain its impetus as a result of the political authoritarianism and economic decay of the post-independence period, which had a particularly damaging impact on Africa's universities. Of late, however, the phrase has come to refer to developments notably in North America and Europe, which in subordinating the study of Africa to agendas in the global North may appropriately be described not as decolonisation but as recolonisation.

Five research clusters were identified, focusing on the origin and evolution of the species, methodological issues and the relatedness among elephant species.ConclusionsResearch in this field should be expanded to additional countries harboring elephant populations to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the population structure and genetic differentiation of the species, and to cope with challenges associated with the conservation of the species such as illegal hunting, habitat fragmentation, species reintroduction and climate change.",scopus,Biology,2016,"USA, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania"
254,254,Postcolonial Reverberations,George O.,2016-01-01,http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/1089201x-3482231,"George's essay responds to Siba Grovogui's book Beyond Eurocentrism and Anarchy. It discusses some implications deriving from Grovogui's critique of international relations discourse from the vantage point of postcolonial literary and cultural criticism. It also explores theoretical directions that the book opens up, specifically as these may enrich interdisciplinary conversations in African studies. Of particular concern is the possibility of moving beyond postcolonial theory's founding critique of area studies scholarship. Beyond theory's critique of the geopolitics of utilitarian knowledge production, George asks, how might Africanist literary studies reengage area studies in ways that enrich both disciplines without subordinating the priorities of postcolonial humanities scholarship?",scopus,Postcolonial Studies,2016,African
255,255,Publishing patterns at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology,Chiware E.,2016-01-01,http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/sajs.2016/20140220,"We report on the publishing and collaborative patterns of researchers in the applied sciences and engineering disciplines at a technological university in South Africa, Cape Peninsula University of Technology. The study focused on works published over a 10-year period (2005–2014) and was based on citations of peer-reviewed literature from Scopus. The results showed a steady growth in research outputs in science and technology at the university. There has also been a growing trend of international collaboration in certain disciplines. This scoping study serves as a benchmark for similar studies.",scopus,Library and Information Science,2016,South Africa
256,256,Open scholarship practices reshaping South Africa’s scholarly publishing roadmap,Raju R.,2015-12-01,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/publications3040263,"South African higher education institutions are the largest producers of research output on the African continent. Given this status, South African researchers have a moral obligation to share their research output with the rest of the continent via a medium that minimizes challenges of access; open scholarship is that medium. The majority of South African higher education libraries provide an open access publishing service. However, in most of these cases this service is via engagement with the green open access route, that is, institutional repositories (IR). Some of the libraries have piloted and adopted gold open access services such as publishing of “diamond” gold open access journals and supporting article processing charges. The experiment with publishing open monographs is a new venture. This venture must be viewed against the backdrop of the need for open educational resources (OERs). OER is an area that is very much in a fledgling stage and is gaining traction, albeit, at a slow pace. The growth of IRs, the growth in support for gold open access including the library acting as a publisher, the experimentation with open monographs, and OERs are all shaping South Africa’s scholarly publishing roadmap.",scopus,Library and Information Science,2015,South Africa
