2) Geology

The study of the 2024 Fentale diking episode provides significant insights into the dynamics of magma-assisted rifting in young and slowly extending continental rifts, such as the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER). Utilizing InSAR and seismic data, the research by Keir D. reveals that from 2021 to mid-2024, the Fentale Volcanic Complex experienced a notable uplift of up to 6 cm. This uplift was a precursor to the diking event that began in mid-September 2024, characterized by the northward propagation of upper crustal dikes along the rift. Initially, this diking was accompanied by subdued seismic activity, but as the dike opening increased to approximately 2 meters and extended over 14 kilometers, seismicity intensified due to normal faulting. This progression underscores the significant role of diking in accommodating rift extension, even in regions with slow extension rates of about 5 mm per year.

The findings from the Fentale diking episode highlight the episodic nature of diking in young continental rifts, drawing parallels to similar processes observed at mid-ocean ridges. Despite the slow extension rate, the diking event accounted for approximately 90% of the total geodetic moment, with the remainder attributed to faulting. This suggests that while diking is less frequent in such settings compared to more rapidly extending rifts, it plays a crucial role in the rifting process. The study enhances our understanding of the interplay between magmatic and tectonic forces in shaping continental rifts, providing a valuable framework for predicting and interpreting similar geological phenomena in other slowly extending rift systems.

3) Public Health

The research conducted by Jiwani S.S. delves into the critical issue of person-centred maternity care (PCMC) in urban informal settlements across Nairobi, Lusaka, and Ouagadougou. As urbanization accelerates in Sub-Saharan Africa, these settlements have expanded, often resulting in suboptimal health outcomes for the poorest women, particularly during childbirth. The study utilized exit surveys from women discharged from childbirth care facilities to assess PCMC levels, focusing on dignity, respect, communication, autonomy, and supportive care. The findings revealed a concerning disparity in PCMC scores, with Ouagadougou scoring the highest at 73.8% and Lusaka the lowest at 57.1%. While women generally reported high levels of dignity and respect, communication and autonomy were notably lacking, indicating a significant area for improvement in maternity care services.

The study further identified several determinants influencing PCMC, highlighting the role of structural, intermediary, and health systems factors. In Ouagadougou, women with formal employment, those who delivered in private for-profit facilities, and those whose newborns received postnatal care before discharge reported higher PCMC scores. Conversely, in Nairobi and Lusaka, the presence of a physician during childbirth and postnatal checks for newborns were associated with better PCMC experiences. These insights underscore the need for targeted quality improvement initiatives to enhance communication and autonomy in maternity care, ensuring that women in these vulnerable communities receive comprehensive and respectful care. By addressing these gaps, health systems can foster better health outcomes and encourage continued care-seeking behavior among women in urban informal settlements.

4) Virology

The study by Wang J. delves into the intricate mechanisms by which SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) achieve high-affinity binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor, a critical step in the viral entry process. Utilizing cryo-electron microscopy, the research unveils the structures of eight distinct S-proteins from SARSr-CoVs across various continents, revealing that these proteins adopt tightly packed, locked prefusion conformations. This structural analysis allows for the classification of SARSr-CoV S-proteins into three types based on their receptor-binding motif (RBM) structures and their binding characteristics with ACE2. Notably, the study highlights that type-2 S-proteins exhibit a preference for binding bat ACE2 (bACE2) over hACE2, suggesting a potential evolutionary pathway for zoonotic transmission.

The research further explores the specificity of ACE2 binding by examining the structure of a type-2 BtKY72-RBD in complex with bACE2. Through structure-guided mutagenesis, the study identifies that multiple synergistic mutations across four regions of the RBM are necessary for achieving high-affinity binding to hACE2. This finding is significant as it demonstrates how specific RBM alterations can enable a primarily non-ACE2 binding S-protein, like the type-2 BM48-31, to acquire the ability to bind hACE2. These insights not only enhance our understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning SARSr-CoV's ability to infect human hosts but also provide a framework for predicting and potentially mitigating future zoonotic spillovers.

7) Finance

In the realm of finance, the determination of the Loss Given Default (LGD) discount rate is crucial for banks to accurately assess their regulatory capital requirements. The research by Janette Larney, Arno Botha, Gerrit Lodewicus Grobler, and Helgard Raubenheimer introduces a novel approach to calculating this rate, drawing inspiration from the cost of capital methodology used in the Solvency II regulatory framework. Traditionally, the discount rate for LGD estimation must account for the time value of money and include a risk premium that captures the "undiversifiable risk" inherent in recovery cash flows. The authors propose a method that estimates a market-consistent price for a portfolio of defaulted loans, allowing for the inference of an appropriate discount rate. This approach is applied to data from mortgage and personal loans at a major South African bank, revealing that the primary factors influencing the discount rate are the mean and variance of recoveries, alongside the bank's cost of capital above the risk-free rate.

This innovative method not only aligns with regulatory requirements by reflecting both the undiversifiable risk and the time value of money but also enhances the accuracy of LGD modeling for both regulatory and economic capital purposes. By focusing on the market-consistent pricing of defaulted loan portfolios, the research provides a more precise and theoretically grounded framework for determining the LGD discount rate. This advancement is particularly significant as it offers a more robust tool for financial institutions to manage risk and capital allocation effectively. The study's findings underscore the importance of integrating market dynamics and cost of capital considerations into the LGD estimation process, potentially leading to more resilient financial systems and improved risk management practices.
