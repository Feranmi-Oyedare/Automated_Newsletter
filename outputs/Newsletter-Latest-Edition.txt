To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a novel approach leveraging the m2m100 multilingual translation model, enhanced with masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining. This method is further refined through fine-tuning on both the Roman-Urdu-Parl dataset and the more diverse Dakshina dataset, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation framework.

The research demonstrates the effectiveness of transformer-based models in low-resource transliteration tasks, achieving impressive Char-BLEU scores of 96.37 for Urdu to Roman-Urdu and 97.44 for Roman-Urdu to Urdu. These results not only surpass the performance of RNN baselines but also outperform the GPT-4o Mini model, underscoring the potential of multilingual transfer learning in enhancing transliteration accuracy. By introducing rigorous dataset splits and employing robust evaluation metrics such as BLEU, character-level BLEU, and CHRF, the study provides a more reliable assessment of transliteration performance. This work not only advances the field of NLP by addressing the transliteration needs of low-resource languages but also sets a precedent for future research in developing inclusive and adaptable language processing models.

30) Physics

The quest to understand dark matter, a mysterious component of the universe, has led to significant research efforts, including the investigation of annual modulation signals. The DAMA/LIBRA experiment, using a sodium-iodide based detector, has claimed for over two decades that it observed an annual modulation signal consistent with dark matter. To test this claim, two independent experiments, COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112, were established in South Korea and Spain, respectively. Both experiments have been collecting data since 2016 and 2017, aiming to replicate or refute the DAMA/LIBRA findings using the same target material. The recent study combines the first three years of data from both COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112, employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to analyze the modulation amplitude in specific energy regions.

The results from this combined analysis present a significant challenge to the DAMA/LIBRA claims. The modulation amplitudes found were $-0.0002 {\pm} 0.0026$ cpd/kg/keV in the 1-6 keV range and $0.0021 {\pm} 0.0028$ cpd/kg/keV in the 2-6 keV range, which are not compatible with the DAMA/LIBRA observations. Furthermore, a simple combination of the six-year datasets from both experiments yielded values consistent with no modulation, with $0.0005 {\pm} 0.0019$ cpd/kg/keV in the 1-6 keV range and $0.0027 {\pm} 0.0021$ cpd/kg/keV in the 2-6 keV range. These findings exclude the DAMA/LIBRA signal with high statistical significance, at $4.68{\sigma}$ and $3.53{\sigma}$, respectively. This research underscores the importance of independent verification in scientific inquiry and suggests that the DAMA/LIBRA signal may not be attributable to dark matter, prompting further investigation into the nature of these signals.
